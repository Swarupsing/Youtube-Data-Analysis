# 🎬 YouTube Data Analysis

## 📃 Introduction
This project aims to analyze YouTube video trends by examining key metrics such as views, likes, comments, and engagement. The objective is to uncover patterns in trending videos and determine factors that contribute to their popularity. By leveraging statistical techniques and data visualization, we gain insights into the dynamics of YouTube's recommendation system and user behavior.

## 📂 Data Source
- **Dataset**: The data was collected from  YouTube API.
- **Features**:
  - `video_id`: Unique identifier for each video
  - `title`: Video title
  - `channel`: Channel name
  - `category`: Video category
  - `views`: Total number of views
  - `likes`: Number of likes
  - `comments`: Number of comments
  - `published_at`: Upload date of the video
  - `trending_days`: Number of days the video was trending

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicate records, and data inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to examine relationships between engagement metrics.
4. **Survival Analysis**: Measuring how long videos remain in trending status.
5. **Machine Learning (if applicable)**: Predicting the likelihood of a video trending based on historical data.

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Videos with higher engagement (likes/comments) tend to stay trending longer.
- Certain categories (e.g., entertainment, music) have a higher probability of trending.
- Upload timing impacts video reach and engagement.
- The number of trending days follows a specific distribution pattern.

## 🌟 Conclusion
The analysis provides key insights into how YouTube videos trend. Understanding these patterns can help content creators optimize their videos for better reach and engagement. Further improvements could include sentiment analysis of comments and deeper exploration of YouTube's recommendation system.
